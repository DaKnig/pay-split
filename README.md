# pay-split

ever had to split the pay evenly at the end of the evening? well now you can,
with this slick, CLI-based app, with minimal transactions.

works on mobile with the power of termux! just clone this repo to get the
latest version.

## how to use it

simply run `./split_pay.py` from the terminal. the program will ask for names
and sums paid by each person, and will save a log under `pay.log` as a simple
text file. type `list` to get a list of the people and how much each person
pays.
